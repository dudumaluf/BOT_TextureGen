# StudioOS: Your Interactive Agentic Workflow

This guide explains how to use your new AI-powered studio.

### A. One-Time Project Setup
1.  **Define Your Vision:** Open `PROJECT_GENESIS.md` and fill out the questionnaire.
2.  **Initiate the AI Architect:** Open the project in Cursor and send the following initial prompt:
    ```
    @.studio-os/00_CREATIVE_DIRECTOR_PROTOCOL.md
    @PROJECT_GENESIS.md

    Adopt the Master Protocol. Your first mission is to build the foundational scaffold for the new application defined in PROJECT_GENESIS.md.
    ```
3.  **The AI Builds the Foundation:** After you approve its plan, the AI will build the entire project foundation for you.

### B. Your New Interactive Workflow
You are the **Creative Director**. The AI is your **Proactive Assistant**. Your development process is now a guided conversation.

1.  **Start a Session:** Begin any new chat with `@.studio-os/00_CREATIVE_DIRECTOR_PROTOCOL.md`.
2.  **The AI Presents an Action Menu:** The AI will analyze the project and present you with a numbered list of logical next steps.
3.  **You Respond:** Simply reply with the number of your choice (e.g., `1`) or type out a new goal. The AI will handle the rest, following the appropriate protocol and always returning with a new Action Menu when it's done.
